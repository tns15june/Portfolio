## Overview

Developed a custom sentiment analysis model supporting multiple languages for a large streaming company. The system performs audience sentiment classification and content strategy optimization, with real-time sentiment tracking improving viewer retention and platform engagement.

## Technical Architecture

### Deep Learning Model
- Custom sentiment classification model
- Transfer learning from pre-trained multilingual models
- Fine-tuned on entertainment content domain
- Multi-label classification (positive, negative, neutral, specific emotions)

### Multilingual Support
- English, Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi support
- Language-specific preprocessing
- Unified sentiment representation across languages
- Cross-lingual sentiment understanding

### Real-Time Processing
- Streaming sentiment analysis on user comments and reviews
- Batch processing for historical data analysis
- Real-time aggregation and trend detection
- Low-latency inference for live feedback

## Key Features

- **Multilingual Analysis**: Handles multiple languages with consistent accuracy
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Immediate sentiment feedback on content
- **Content Optimization**: Insights for content strategy and recommendations
- **Viewer Retention**: Sentiment-driven personalization improves engagement
- **Platform Integration**: Seamless integration with existing streaming infrastructure

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Multilingual Sentiment Consistency
Different languages express sentiment differently, requiring consistent interpretation.

**Solution**: Used multilingual transformer models (mBERT/XLM-R) as foundation, created language-aligned training datasets, and implemented cross-lingual validation to ensure consistency.

### Challenge: Entertainment Domain Specificity
General sentiment models struggled with entertainment-specific language (reviews, reactions, fan expressions).

**Solution**: Fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets including movie reviews, show comments, and fan reactions. Created custom training data with platform-specific sentiment nuances.

### Challenge: Real-Time Scale
Needed to process large volumes of user comments in real-time across popular shows.

**Solution**: Implemented efficient model serving with batching, deployed on GPU infrastructure, and designed tiered processing (critical content gets priority).

## Impact

- **Improved Viewer Retention**: Sentiment-driven recommendations kept viewers engaged longer
- **Enhanced Personalization**: Better understanding of viewer preferences
- **Content Strategy Optimization**: Insights from sentiment analysis informed content decisions
- **Platform Engagement**: Overall increase in user interaction metrics

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, Transformers (mBERT, XLM-R)
- **NLP**: Tokenization, text preprocessing, language detection
- **Deployment**: Model serving, GPU inference
- **Languages**: Python, multilingual NLP libraries

## Innovation

- **Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning**: Customized sentiment understanding for entertainment content
- **Multilingual Consistency**: Achieved uniform sentiment interpretation across languages
- **Real-Time Recommendations**: Integrated sentiment insights into recommendation engine
