## Overview

Developed a specialized NLP model for semiconductor industry ticket management, achieving **42% cost reduction** through intelligent automation. The system classifies and routes technical support tickets, streamlining operations and significantly reducing manual processing overhead.

## Technical Architecture

### NLP Classification Model
- Multi-class text classification for ticket types
- Technical domain understanding (semiconductor-specific terminology)
- Intent recognition and severity assessment
- Custom NER for component and issue identification

### Automation Pipeline
- Automated ticket intake and preprocessing
- Intelligent classification and priority assignment
- Automated routing to appropriate teams
- Escalation logic for high-priority issues

### Domain Adaptation
- Training on semiconductor industry data
- Technical terminology handling
- Company-specific component catalogues
- Historical ticket patterns

## Key Features

- **Automated Classification**: Instant categorization of incoming tickets
- **Intelligent Routing**: Direct tickets to appropriate specialists
- **Priority Assessment**: Automatic severity and urgency determination
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduced manual triage and routing effort
- **Technical Understanding**: Handles semiconductor-specific language

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Technical Domain Complexity
Semiconductor industry has highly specialized terminology and complex technical descriptions.

**Solution**: Built domain-specific vocabulary from technical documentation and historical tickets. Fine-tuned pre-trained models on semiconductor corpus. Created custom NER for component names and issue types specific to the industry.

### Challenge: Varied Ticket Quality
Tickets ranged from well-structured engineer reports to vague user complaints.

**Solution**: Implemented robust preprocessing handling varied input quality. Created confidence scoring system – high-confidence predictions automated, low-confidence flagged for review. Built feedback loop improving model on ambiguous cases.

### Challenge: Class Imbalance
Some ticket types were much more common than others.

**Solution**: Used class-balanced training with weighted loss functions. Implemented oversampling for rare categories. Designed threshold optimization per class rather than global threshold.

## Impact

- **42% Cost Reduction**: Dramatic decrease in operational costs through automation
- **Streamlined Operations**: Faster ticket resolution through efficient routing
- **Improved Response Times**: Immediate classification and routing
- **Better Resource Allocation**: Specialists focused on resolution, not triage

## Technologies Used

- **NLP**: Transformers (BERT), spaCy, custom NER
- **ML**: scikit-learn, text classification
- **Text Processing**: Tokenization, technical terminology handling
- **Deployment**: Model serving, monitoring
- **Languages**: Python

## Cost Reduction Breakdown

The 42% cost savings came from:
- Reduced manual ticket triage time (primary factor)
- Faster routing to correct teams (reduced hand-offs)
- Better priority assessment (efficient resource allocation)
- Decreased escalation cycles (accurate initial routing)

## Innovation

- **Domain-Specific NLP**: Tailored solution for semiconductor industry
- **End-to-End Automation**: Complete pipeline from ticket intake to routing
- **Continuous Learning**: System improved from feedback and new ticket patterns
