## Overview

Architected and implemented a production-grade enterprise AI chat platform featuring advanced RAG capabilities, multi-model LLM support, and an innovative agentic tool framework. The platform enables organizations to leverage their knowledge bases through intelligent conversational AI with real-time streaming responses.

## Technical Architecture

### RAG Pipeline
- **AWS Bedrock**: Core LLM inference with multi-model support
- **OpenSearch**: Vector search and semantic retrieval at scale
- **AWS Step Functions**: Orchestrated document ingestion, chunking, and embedding workflows
- **Intelligent Chunking**: Optimized document segmentation for context preservation

### Multi-Model LLM Support
- **Claude** (Anthropic): Primary model for complex reasoning and generation
- **Amazon Nova**: Cost-effective alternative for simpler queries
- **Mistral**: High-performance open model for specific use cases
- Dynamic model routing based on query complexity and cost optimization

### Real-Time Communication
- **WebSocket Integration**: Low-latency streaming responses
- Token-by-token streaming for improved user experience
- Connection state management and automatic reconnection
- Concurrent session handling at scale

## Agentic Tool Framework

Developed a sophisticated agentic architecture enabling the AI to perform complex multi-step tasks:

### Knowledge Retrieval Agent
- Semantic search across enterprise document repositories
- Contextual ranking and relevance scoring
- Source attribution and citation generation

### Lesson Planning Agent
- Automated curriculum generation based on learning objectives
- Adaptive content structuring for different skill levels
- Integration with educational content repositories

### Quiz Generation Agent
- Dynamic assessment creation from source materials
- Multiple question formats (MCQ, short answer, essay prompts)
- Difficulty calibration based on content complexity

## Safety & Evaluation

### Bedrock Guardrails
- Content moderation for input and output
- PII detection and redaction
- Topic filtering for off-limits subjects
- Custom policy enforcement for enterprise compliance

### Evaluation Pipeline
- **DeepEval Integration**: Comprehensive LLM evaluation framework
- 20+ evaluation metrics including faithfulness, relevance, and coherence
- Automated regression testing for model updates
- A/B testing infrastructure for prompt optimization

## Cost Optimization

### Usage Metrics & Monitoring
- Token consumption tracking per user/organization
- Cost attribution and chargeback reporting
- **CloudWatch Integration**: Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Automated cost anomaly detection

### Optimization Strategies
- Intelligent caching for repeated queries
- Model tiering based on query complexity
- Prompt optimization for token efficiency
- Batch processing for non-interactive workloads

## Key Features

- **Enterprise SSO**: Seamless authentication integration
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permission control
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Isolated environments per organization
- **API Gateway**: RESTful APIs for third-party integration

## Technologies Used

- **LLMs**: Claude, Amazon Nova, Mistral (via AWS Bedrock)
- **Vector Search**: OpenSearch
- **Orchestration**: AWS Step Functions, Lambda
- **Real-Time**: WebSocket, API Gateway
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, DeepEval
- **Languages**: Python, TypeScript
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK, Docker

## Impact

- **Production Deployment**: Serving enterprise customers at scale
- **Multi-Model Flexibility**: Optimized cost-performance across use cases
- **Agentic Capabilities**: Advanced tool use beyond simple Q&A
- **Enterprise-Grade Safety**: Comprehensive guardrails for production use
- **Observable AI**: Full visibility into system performance and costs
