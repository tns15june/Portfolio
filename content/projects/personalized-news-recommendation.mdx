## Overview

Built a sophisticated personalized recommendation system for a news platform using **entity recognition** and **knowledge graphs** for content relevance improvement. The system integrates trending news summaries with a real-time recommendation engine to boost user engagement and interaction.

## Technical Architecture

### NLP & Entity Recognition
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) for content tagging
- Topic modeling and categorization
- Sentiment analysis for content mood
- Entity linking to knowledge bases

### Knowledge Graph
- Graph database for entity relationships
- Content similarity networks
- User interest graphs
- Trending topic tracking

### Recommendation Engine
- Collaborative filtering
- Content-based filtering
- Hybrid recommendation approach
- Real-time update mechanism

## Key Features

- **Personalized Content**: Tailored news recommendations based on user interests
- **Entity-Based Matching**: Uses entity recognition to understand content relationships
- **Trending Integration**: Incorporates trending news summaries
- **Real-Time Updates**: Dynamic recommendations as news breaks
- **Enhanced Engagement**: Optimized for user retention and interaction

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Cold Start Problem
New users and new articles lacked historical data for recommendations.

**Solution**: Implemented hybrid approach combining content-based filtering (using entities and topics) with popularity-based recommendations for cold start scenarios. Knowledge graphs helped establish initial content relationships.

### Challenge: Real-Time Processing at Scale
News platform required instant recommendations as new articles published.

**Solution**: Built streaming pipeline for real-time entity extraction and graph updates. Implemented caching strategies and pre-computed similarity scores for frequently accessed content.

### Challenge: Diverse User Interests
Users had varied and evolving interests requiring adaptive recommendations.

**Solution**: Designed dynamic user interest graphs that updated based on reading patterns, implemented time-decay for evolving preferences, and used entity-level tracking (rather than just article-level) for fine-grained understanding.

## Impact

- **Increased User Engagement**: Significantly boosted interaction across news platform
- **Improved Retention**: Enhanced user retention through relevant content delivery
- **Real-Time Relevance**: Dynamic recommendations kept content fresh and timely
- **Better User Experience**: Personalization led to higher satisfaction metrics

## Technologies Used

- **NLP**: spaCy, Named Entity Recognition, Topic Modeling
- **Graph DB**: Neo4j / NetworkX for knowledge graphs
- **Recommendation**: Collaborative & content-based filtering
- **Real-Time**: Streaming processing for live updates
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI

## Innovation

- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Novel use of entity relationships for news recommendation
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combined multiple recommendation strategies for robustness
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Dynamic system responding to breaking news and trends
