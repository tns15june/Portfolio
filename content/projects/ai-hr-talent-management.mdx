## Overview

Designed an internal HR system leveraging NLP for automated skill extraction and intelligent JD-CV (Job Description-CV) matching. The system enables talent database management, automated candidate-job matching, and recruitment optimization through AI-driven analytics.

## Technical Architecture

### NLP-Based Resume Parsing
- Automated resume parsing and information extraction
- Skill extraction using NER and custom pattern matching
- Experience and education parsing
- Standardized candidate profile generation

### JD-CV Matching Engine
- Semantic similarity between job descriptions and resumes
- Skills-based matching algorithm
- Experience level matching
- Cultural fit indicators

### Talent Database
- Centralized candidate database with rich profiles
- Skill-based search and filtering
- Talent pool segmentation
- Historical hiring pattern analysis

## Key Features

- **Automated Resume Parsing**: Extract structured information from diverse resume formats
- **Intelligent Matching**: AI-driven candidate-job matching
- **Skill-Gap Analysis**: Identify skill gaps for workforce planning
- **Recruitment Analytics**: Data-driven insights for hiring decisions
- **Workflow Automation**: Streamlined recruitment processes

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Diverse Resume Formats
Resumes came in various formats, structures, and languages.

**Solution**: Built robust parsing system handling PDFs, Word documents, and images. Implemented OCR for scanned resumes, created format-agnostic information extraction, and used NER with custom rules for structured data extraction.

### Challenge: Semantic Job-Candidate Matching
Simple keyword matching missed semantic relationships between skills and requirements.

**Solution**: Implemented semantic embedding-based matching using sentence transformers. Created skill taxonomy with synonym and related-skill mappings. Designed scoring algorithm considering both required and preferred qualifications.

### Challenge: Skill Taxonomy Management
Needed standardized skill names despite varied terminology in resumes.

**Solution**: Built comprehensive skill taxonomy with synonym mappings, implemented fuzzy matching for skill normalization, and created skills clustering for related competencies.

## Impact

- **Improved Talent Acquisition Efficiency**: Automated candidate screening reduced time-to-hire
- **Better Hiring Decisions**: AI-driven analytics and matching improved hire quality
- **Streamlined Workflows**: Automation reduced manual effort in recruitment
- **Skill-Gap Identification**: Analytics enabled proactive workforce planning
- **Scalable Talent Management**: System grew with organizational hiring needs

## Technologies Used

- **NLP**: spaCy, Named Entity Recognition, skill extraction
- **ML**: Sentence transformers, semantic similarity
- **Resume Parsing**: PDFMiner, python-docx, OCR (Tesseract)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for talent database
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI

## Innovation

- **End-to-End HR Automation**: Complete pipeline from resume intake to candidate matching
- **Semantic Understanding**: Beyond keyword matching to skill relationship understanding
- **Analytics Integration**: Data-driven insights for strategic workforce planning
