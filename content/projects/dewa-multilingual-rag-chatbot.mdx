## Overview

Led the development of a sophisticated multilingual chatbot for Dubai Electricity & Water Authority (DEWA), one of the largest utility companies in the Middle East. The system provides intelligent query handling in both Arabic and English, leveraging state-of-the-art RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) architecture.

## Technical Architecture

### LLM & Embedding Models
- **Claude 3** for natural language understanding and generation
- **Cohere v3 embedding models** for semantic search across multilingual documents
- Advanced prompt engineering for context-aware responses
- Multilingual query understanding (Arabic & English)

### Cloud Infrastructure
- **AWS SageMaker**: Model deployment and inference
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute for scalable request handling
- **SharePoint Integration**: Seamless document ingestion from enterprise content management
- **Vector Database**: Efficient semantic search across large document collections

### RAG Pipeline
1. Document ingestion from SharePoint repositories
2. Multilingual text extraction and preprocessing
3. Semantic chunking optimized for Arabic/English content
4. Cohere v3 embeddings for vector representation
5. Efficient retrieval with similarity search
6. Claude 3 generation with retrieved context

## Key Features

- **Bilingual Support**: Native Arabic and English query handling
- **Enterprise Integration**: Seamless SharePoint document processing
- **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Context-aware responses with source attribution
- **Performance Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of query patterns and response quality
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Secure handling of utility company data

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Multilingual Semantic Understanding
Arabic and English have vastly different linguistic structures, making it challenging to maintain consistent semantic understanding across languages.

**Solution**: Implemented language-specific preprocessing pipelines with Cohere v3 multilingual embeddings, which excel at cross-lingual semantic similarity. Designed prompt templates that explicitly handle language context switching.

### Challenge: Document Processing at Scale
DEWA maintains extensive documentation in mixed Arabic/English formats across SharePoint.

**Solution**: Built automated document ingestion pipeline with intelligent language detection, OCR for scanned documents, and optimized chunking strategies that preserve semantic coherence in both languages.

### Challenge: Response Accuracy & Hallucination Prevention
Critical utility information requires high accuracy and fact-grounding.

**Solution**: Implemented strict RAG retrieval with relevance scoring, source attribution in all responses, and confidence thresholds. Created comprehensive evaluation framework with Middle East stakeholders.

## Impact

- **Enterprise-Grade Performance**: Deployed at scale for DEWA operations
- **Multilingual Accuracy**: Optimized response accuracy across Arabic and English queries
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Close collaboration with Middle East stakeholders ensured cultural and linguistic appropriateness
- **Performance Insights**: Analytics dashboard provides actionable insights into query patterns

## Technologies Used

- **LLMs**: Claude 3 (Anthropic)
- **Embeddings**: Cohere v3
- **Cloud**: AWS SageMaker, AWS Lambda
- **Integration**: SharePoint APIs
- **Vector DB**: FAISS / ChromaDB
- **Languages**: Python, FastAPI

## Collaboration & Leadership

- Led development team coordinating with **Middle East stakeholders**
- Pioneered advanced prompt engineering techniques for multilingual RAG
- Designed and implemented performance analytics dashboard
- Established RAG architecture patterns for enterprise deployment
